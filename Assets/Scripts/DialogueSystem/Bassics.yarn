Bassics: You're finally awake. How are you feeling?
Bassics: Are you curious about your Poncho? You looked cold, so I made it for you.
Bassics: No... 
Bassics: That look in your eyes... 
Bassics: You're thinking about the Mountain.
Bassics: You want... need to go there.
Bassics: ...
Bassics: This Island, once vibrant, lays vacant.
Bassics: And there It lays, slumbering upon that Mountaintop.
Bassics: The power to restore this world back to the way it was.
