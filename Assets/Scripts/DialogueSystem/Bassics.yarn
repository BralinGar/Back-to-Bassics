Bassics: You are finally awake.
Bassics: How are you feeling?
Bassics: Do you have the urge to shred others?
Bassics: ...
Bassics: Perhaps not.
Bassics: Besides you and I, the rest do.
Bassics: And I need someone to restore this world back to the way it was.
Bassics: You and I are gonna go on a long journey to bring this world back to the way it was.
